# Multipart Form Data with Matching Rules

This entry demonstrates how to use Pact matching rules with multipart/form-data requests. Specifically, it demonstrates how multipart data is specified on the consumer side, and how matching rules can be applied to different parts of the multipart body.

For full implementation details, see the code and docstrings in this directory. For general catalog usage, prerequisites, and test-running instructions, see the [main catalog README](../README.md).
