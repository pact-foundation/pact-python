"""
Example Client Code.

This module defines a simple consumer and a couple of implementation of simple
providers. The general premise here is that the consumers will be fetching user
information from the providers.

The development of the consumer and provider sides would typically be done in
separate teams (and likely different languages). Within the Pact framework, the
consumer side is the one which defines the contract and the provider side is the
one which must satisfy the contract.
