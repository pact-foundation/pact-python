"""
Consumer contract tests using Pact.

This module demonstrates how to test a consumer (see
[`consumer.py`][examples.http.aiohttp_and_flask.consumer]) against a mock
provider using Pact. The mock provider is set up by Pact to validate that the
consumer makes the expected requests and can handle the provider's responses.
Once validated, the contract can be published to a Pact Broker for use in
provider verification.

For more information on consumer testing with Pact, see the [Pact Consumer
Test](https://docs.pact.io/5-minute-getting-started-guide#scope-of-a-consumer-pact-test)
section of the Pact documentation.
