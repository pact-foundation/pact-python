"""
Simple Consumer Implementation.

This modules defines a simple
[consumer](https://docs.pact.io/getting_started/terminology#service-consumer)
which will be tested with Pact in the [consumer
test][examples.http.aiohttp_and_flask.test_consumer]. As Pact is a
consumer-driven framework, the consumer defines the interactions which the
provider must then satisfy.

The consumer is the application which makes requests to another service (the
provider) and receives a response to process. In this example, we have a simple
`User` class and the consumer fetches a user's information from a HTTP endpoint.

This also showcases how Pact tests differ from merely testing adherence to an
OpenAPI specification. The Pact tests are more concerned with the practical use
of the API, rather than the formally defined specification. So you will see
below that as far as this consumer is concerned, the only information needed
from the provider is the user's ID, name, and creation date. This is despite the
provider having additional fields in the response.

Note that the code in this module is agnostic of Pact (i.e., this would be your
production code). The `pact-python` dependency only appears in the tests. This
is because the consumer is not concerned with Pact, only the tests are.
