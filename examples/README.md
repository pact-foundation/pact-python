## Overview

Here you can find examples of how to use Pact using the python language. You can find more of an overview on Pact in the
[Pact Introduction].

Examples are given of both the [Consumer] and [Provider], this does not mean however that you must use python for both.
Different languages can be mixed and matched as required.

In these examples, `1` is just used to meet the need of having *some* [Consumer] or [Provider] version. In reality, you
will generally want to use something more complicated and automated. Guidelines and best practices are available in the
[Versioning in the Pact Broker]

## broker

The [Pact Broker] stores [Pact file]s and [Pact verification] results. It is used here for the [consumer](#consumer),
[flask_provider](#flask-provider) and [message](#message) tests.

### Running

These examples run the [Pact Broker] as part of the tests when specified. It can be run outside the tests as well by
performing the following command from a separate terminal in the `examples/broker` folder:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

You should then be able to open a browser and navigate to http://localhost where you will initially be able to see the
default Example App/Example API Pact.

Running the [Pact Broker] outside the tests will mean you are able to then see the [Pact file]s submitted to the
[Pact Broker] as the various tests are performed.

## common

To avoid needing to duplicate certain fixtures, such as starting up a docker based Pact broker (to demonstrate how the
test process could work), the shared fixtures used by the pytests have all been placed into a single location.]
This means it is easier to see the relevant code for the example without having to go through the boilerplate fixtures.
See [Requiring/Loading plugins in a test module or conftest file] for further details of this approach.

## consumer

Pact is consumer-driven, which means first the contracts are created. These Pact contracts are generated during
execution of the consumer tests.

### Running

When the tests are run, the "minimum" is to generate the Pact contract JSON, additional options are available. The
following commands can be run from the `examples/consumer` folder:

- Install any necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
- To startup the broker, run the tests, and publish the results to the broker:
    ```bash
    pytest --run-broker True --publish-pact 1 
    ```
- Alternatively the same can be performed with the following command, which is called from a `make consumer`:
    ```bash
    ./run_pytest.sh
    ```
- To run the tests, and publish the results to the broker which is already running:
    ```bash
    pytest --publish-pact 1
    ```
- To just run the tests:
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```

### Output

The following file(s) will be created when the tests are run:

| Filename                                    | Contents  |
|---------------------------------------------| ----------|
| consumer/pact-mock-service.log              | All interactions with the mock provider such as expected interactions, requests, and interaction verifications. |
| consumer/userserviceclient-userservice.json | This contains the Pact interactions between the `UserServiceClient` and `UserService`, as defined in the tests. The naming being derived from the named Pacticipants: `Consumer("UserServiceClient")` and `Provider("UserService")` |

## flask_provider

The Flask [Provider] example consists of a basic Flask app, with a single endpoint route.
This implements the service expected by the [consumer](#consumer).

Functionally, this provides the same service and tests as the [fastapi_provider](#fastapi_provider). Both are included to
demonstrate how Pact can be used in different environments with different technology stacks and approaches.

The [Provider] side is responsible for performing the tests to verify if it is compliant with the [Pact file] contracts
associated with it.

As such, the tests use the pact-python Verifier to perform this verification. Two approaches are demonstrated:
- Testing against the [Pact broker]. Generally this is the preferred approach, see information on [Sharing Pacts].
- Testing against the [Pact file] directly. If no [Pact broker] is available you can verify against a static [Pact file].

### Running

To avoid package version conflicts with different applications, it is recommended to run these tests from a
[Virtual Environment]

The following commands can be run from within your [Virtual Environment], in the `examples/flask_provider`.

To perform the python tests:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # Install the dependencies for the Flask example
pip install -e ../../           # Using setup.py in the pact-python root, install any pact dependencies and pact-python
./run_pytest.sh                 # Wrapper script to first run Flask, and then run the tests
```

To perform verification using CLI to verify the [Pact file] against the Flask [Provider] instead of the python tests:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # Install the dependencies for the Flask example
./verify_pact.sh                # Wrapper script to first run Flask, and then use `pact-verifier` to verify locally
```

To perform verification using CLI, but verifying the [Pact file] previously provided by a [Consumer], and publish the
results. This example requires that the [Pact broker] is already running, and the [Consumer] tests have been published
already, described in the [consumer](#consumer) section above.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # Install the dependencies for the Flask example
./verify_pact.sh 1              # Wrapper script to first run Flask, and then use `pact-verifier` to verify and publish
```

These examples demonstrate by first launching Flask via a `python -m flask run`, you may prefer to start Flask using an
`app.run()` call in the python code instead, see [How to Run a Flask Application]. Additionally for tests, you may want
to manage starting and stopping Flask as part of a fixture setup. Any approach can be chosen here, in line with your
existing Flask testing practices.

### Output

The following file(s) will be created when the tests are run

| Filename                    | Contents  |
|-----------------------------| ----------|
| flask_provider/log/pact.log | All Pact interactions with the Flask Provider. Every interaction example retrieved from the Pact Broker will be performed during the Verification test; the request/response logged here. | 

## fastapi_provider

The FastAPI [Provider] example consists of a basic FastAPI app, with a single endpoint route.
This implements the service expected by the [consumer](#consumer).

Functionally, this provides the same service and tests as the [flask_provider](#flask_provider). Both are included to
demonstrate how Pact can be used in different environments with different technology stacks and approaches.

The [Provider] side is responsible for performing the tests to verify if it is compliant with the [Pact file] contracts
associated with it.

As such, the tests use the pact-python Verifier to perform this verification. Two approaches are demonstrated:
- Testing against the [Pact broker]. Generally this is the preferred approach, see information on [Sharing Pacts].
- Testing against the [Pact file] directly. If no [Pact broker] is available you can verify against a static [Pact file].

pip install -r requirements.txt # Install the dependencies for the FastAPI example
./verify_pact.sh                # Wrapper script to first run FastAPI, and then use `pact-verifier` to verify locally

| fastapi_provider/log/pact.log | All Pact interactions with the FastAPI Provider. Every interaction example retrieved from the Pact Broker will be performed during the Verification test; the request/response logged here. | 


## message

TODO

## pacts

Both the Flask and the FastAPI [Provider] examples implement the same service the [Consumer] example interacts with.
This folder contains the generated [Pact file] for reference, which is also used when running the [Provider] tests
without a [Pact Broker].
