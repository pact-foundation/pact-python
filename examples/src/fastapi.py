"""
FastAPI provider example.

This modules defines a simple
[provider](https://docs.pact.io/getting_started/terminology#service-provider)
which will be tested with Pact in the [provider
test][examples.tests.test_01_provider_fastapi]. As Pact is a consumer-driven
framework, the consumer defines the contract which the provider must then
satisfy.

The provider is the application which receives requests from another service
(the consumer) and returns a response. In this example, we have a simple
endpoint which returns a user's information from a (fake) database.

This also showcases how Pact tests differ from merely testing adherence to an
OpenAPI specification. The Pact tests are more concerned with the practical use
of the API, rather than the formally defined specification. The User class
defined here has additional fields which are not used by the consumer. Should
the provider later decide to add or remove fields, Pact's consumer-driven
testing will provide feedback on whether the consumer is compatible with the
provider's changes.

Note that the code in this module is agnostic of Pact. The `pact-python`
dependency only appears in the tests. This is because the consumer is not
concerned with Pact, only the tests are.

As this is a simple example, we'll use a simple dict to represent a database.
This would be replaced with a real database in a real application.

When testing the provider in a real application, the calls to the database would
be mocked out to avoid the need for a real database. An example of this can be
found in the [test suite][examples.tests.test_01_provider_fastapi].
