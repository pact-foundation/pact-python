"""
Test the FastAPI provider with Pact.

This module demonstrates how to write a provider test using Pact Python's
upcoming version 3. Pact, being a consumer-driven testing tool, requires that
the provider respond to the requests defined by the consumer. The consumer
defines the expected interactions with the provider, and the provider is
expected to respond with the expected responses.

This module tests the FastAPI provider defined in `src/fastapi.py` against the
mock consumer. The mock consumer is set up by Pact and will replay the requests
defined by the consumers. Pact will then validate that the provider responds
with the expected responses.

The provider will be expected to be in a given state in order to respond to
certain requests. For example, when fetching a user's information, the provider
will need to have a user with the given ID in the database. In order to avoid
side effects, the provider's database calls are mocked out using functionalities
from `unittest.mock`.

In order to set the provider into the correct state, this test module defines an
additional endpoint on the provider, in this case `/_pact/callback`. Calls to
this endpoint mock the relevant database calls to set the provider into the
correct state.

    Handler for the provider state callback.

    For Pact to be able to correctly tests compliance with the contract, the
    internal state of the provider needs to be set up correctly. For example, if
    the consumer expects a user to exist in the database, the provider needs to
    have a user with the given ID in the database.

    NaÃ¯vely, this can be achieved by setting up the database with the correct
    data for the test, but this can be slow and error-prone, and requires
    standing up additional infrastructure. The alternative showcased here is to
    mock the relevant calls to the database so as to avoid any side effects. The
    `unittest.mock` library is used to achieve this as part of the `setup`
    action.

    The added benefit of using this approach is that the mock can subsequently
    be inspected to ensure that the correct calls were made to the database. For
    example, asserting that the correct user ID was retrieved from the database.
    These checks are performed as part of the `teardown` action. This action can
    also be used to reset the mock, or in the case were a real database is used,
    to clean up any side effects.

    Args:
        action:
            One of `setup` or `teardown`. Determines whether the provider state
            should be set up or torn down.

        state:
            The name of the state to set up or tear down.

    Returns:

    Test the FastAPI provider with Pact.

    This function performs all of the provider testing. It runs as follows:

    1.  The FastAPI server is started in a separate process. A small wait time
        is added to allow the server to start up before the tests begin.
    2.  The Verifier is created and configured.

        1.  The `set_info` method tells Pact the names of provider to be tested.
            Pact will automatically discover all the consumers that have
            contracts with this provider.

            The `url` parameter is used to specify the base URL of the provider
            against which the tests will be run.
        2.  The `add_source` method adds the directory where the pact files are
            stored. In a more typical setup, this would in fact be a Pact Broker
            URL.
        3.  The `set_state` method defines the endpoint on the provider that
            will be called to set the provider into the correct state before the
            tests begin. At present, this is the only way to set the provider
            into the correct state; however, future version of Pact Python
            intend to provide a more Pythonic way to do this.

    3.  The `verify` method is called to run the tests. This will run all the
        tests defined in the pact files and verify that the provider responds
        correctly to each request. More specifically, for each interaction, it
        will perform the following steps:

        1.  The provider state(s) are by sending a POST request to the
            provider's `_pact/callback` endpoint.
        2.  Pact impersonates the consumer by sending a request to the provider.
        3.  The provider handles the request and sends a response back to Pact.
        4.  Pact validates the response against the expected response defined in
            the pact file.
        5.  If `teardown` is set to `True` for `set_state`, Pact will send a
            `teardown` action to the provider to reset the provider state(s).

    Pact will output the results of the tests to the console and verify that the
    provider is compliant with the contract. If the provider is not compliant,
    the tests will fail and the output will show which interactions failed and
    why.
