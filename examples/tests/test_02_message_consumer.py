"""
Test Message Pact consumer.

Pact was originally designed for HTTP interactions involving a request and a
response. Message Pact is an addition to Pact that allows for testing of
non-HTTP interactions, such as message queues. This example demonstrates how to
use Message Pact to test whether a consumer can handle the messages it. Due to
the large number of possible transports, Message Pact does not provide a mock
provider and the tests only verifies the messages.

A note on terminology, the _consumer_ for Message Pact is the system that
receives the message, and the _provider_ is the system that sends the message.
Pact is still consumer-driven, and the consumer defines the expected messages it
will receive from the provider. When the provider is being verified, Pact
ensures that the provider sends the expected messages.

In this example, Pact simply ensures that the consumer is capable of processing
the message. The consumer need not send back a message, and any sideffects of
the message must be verified separately (such as through `assert` statements or
as part of the usual unit testing suite).

> :warning: There is currently a bug whereby the `given` and
`expects_to_receive` have swapped meanings compared to the reference
implementation. This will be addressed in a future release.

A good resource for understanding the message pact testing can be found [in the
Pact
documentation](https://docs.pact.io/getting_started/how_pact_works#non-http-testing-message-pact).
