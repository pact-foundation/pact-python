# Releasing

## Preparing the release

The easiest way is to just run the following command from the root folder with the HEAD commit on trunk and the appropriate version. We follow `<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>` versioning.

```shell
script/release_prep.sh X.Y.Z
```

This script effectively runs the following:

1.  Increment the version according to semantic versioning rules in `pact/__version__.py`

2.  Update the `CHANGELOG.md` using:

    ```shell
    git log --pretty=format:'  * %h - %s (%an, %ad)' vX.Y.Z..HEAD
    ```

3.  Add files to git

    ```shell
    git add CHANGELOG.md pact/__version__.py
    ```

4.  Commit

    ```shell
    git commit -m "Releasing version X.Y.Z"
    ```

5.  Tag

    ```shell
    git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Releasing version X.Y.Z"
    git push origin master --tags
    ```

## Updating Pact Ruby

To upgrade the versions of `pact-mock_service` and `pact-provider-verifier`, change the `PACT_STANDALONE_VERSION` in `setup.py` to match the latest version available from the [pact-ruby-standalone](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-ruby-standalone/releases) repository. Do this before preparing the release.

## Publishing to pypi

1.  Wait until GitHub Actions have run and the new tag is available at `https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-python/releases/tag/vX.Y.Z`

2.  Set the title to `pact-python-X.Y.Z`

3.  Save

4.  Go to GitHub Actions for Pact Python and you should see an 'Upload Python Package' action blocked for your version.

5.  Click this and then 'Review deployments'. Select 'Upload Python Package' and Approve deploy. If you can't do this you may need an administrator to give you permissions or do it for you. You should see in Slack #pact-python that the release has happened. Verify in [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/pact-python/)
