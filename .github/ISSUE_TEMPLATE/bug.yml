        ## Please help us help you!

        Before filing your issue, ask yourself:

        - Has this bug already been reported?
        - Is this clearly a Pact Python bug?
        - Do I have basic ideas about where it goes wrong?
        - Could it be because of something on my end?

        **The GitHub issue tracker is not a support forum**. If you are not sure whether it could be on your end or within Pact Python, ask on [Slack](https://slack.pact.io).

        Make the bug obvious. Ideally, we should be able to understand it without running any code.

        Bugs are fixed faster if you include:
        - A reproduction repository to replicate the issue
        - Pact files
        - Logs

        Paste the link to an example repo if possible, and exact instructions to reproduce the issue.

        > **What happens if you skip this step?** Someone will read your bug report, and maybe will be able to help you, but if we fail to reproduce the issue, we might not be able to fix it.

        Please remember that:

        - Issues without reproducible demos have a very low priority.
        - The person fixing the bug would have to do that anyway. Please be respectful of their time.
        - You might figure out the issues yourself as you work on extracting it.

        Thanks for helping us help you!
