# Pact Python CLI

> [!NOTE]
>
> This package is used to package and bundle the Pact CLI _only_. It does not provide any Python functionality or API.

---

This sub-package is part of the [Pact Python](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-python) project and exists solely to distribute the [Pact CLI](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-ruby-standalone) as a Python package. If you are looking for the main Pact Python library for contract testing, please see the [root package](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-python#pact-python).

It is used by version 2 of Pact Python, and can be used to install the Pact CLI in Python environments.

## Installation

You can install this package via pip:

```console
pip install pact-python-cli
```

## Contributing

Contributions to this package are generally not required as it contains minimal Python functionality and generally only requires updating the version number. To contribute to the Pact CLI itself, please refer to the [Pact Ruby Standalone repository](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-ruby-standalone).
