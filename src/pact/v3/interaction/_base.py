    Interaction between a consumer and a provider.

    This abstract class defines an interaction between a consumer and a
    provider. The concrete subclasses define the type of interaction, and

    -  [`SyncMessageInteraction`][pact.v3.interaction.SyncMessageInteraction]

    # Interaction Part

    For HTTP and synchronous message interactions, the interaction is split into
    two parts: the request and the response. The interaction part is used to
    specify which part of the interaction is being set. This is specified using
    the `part` argument of various methods (which defaults to an intelligent
    choice based on the order of the methods called).

    The asynchronous message interaction does not have parts, as the interaction
    contains a single message from the provider (a.ka. the producer of the
    message) to the consumer. An attempt to set a response part will raise an
    error.

        Set the provider state.

        This is the state that the provider should be in when the Interaction is
        executed. When the provider is being verified, the provider state is
        passed to the provider so that its internal state can be set to match
        the provider state.

        In its simplest form, the provider state is a string. For example, to
        match a provider state of `a user exists`, you would use:

        ```python
        pact.upon_receiving("a request").given("a user exists")
        ```

        It is also possible to specify a parameter that will be used to match
        the provider state. For example, to match a provider state of `a user
        exists` with a parameter `id` that has the value `123`, you would use:

        ```python
        (
            pact.upon_receiving("a request").given(
                "a user exists",
                name="id",
                value="123",
            )
        )
        ```

        Lastly, it is possible to specify multiple parameters that will be used
        to match the provider state. For example, to match a provider state of
        `a user exists` with a parameter `id` that has the value `123` and a
        parameter `name` that has the value `John`, you would use:

        ```python
        (
            pact.upon_receiving("a request").given(
                "a user exists",
                parameters={
                    "id": "123",
                    "name": "John",
                },
            )
        )
        ```

        This function can be called repeatedly to specify multiple provider
        states for the same Interaction. If the same `state` is specified with
        different parameters, then the parameters are merged together. The above
        example with multiple parameters can equivalently be specified as:

        ```python
        (
            pact.upon_receiving("a request")
            .given("a user exists", name="id", value="123")
            .given("a user exists", name="name", value="John")
        )
        ```

        Args:
            state:
                Provider state for the Interaction.

            name:
                Name of the parameter. This must be specified in conjunction
                with `value`.

            value:
                Value of the parameter. This must be specified in conjunction
                with `name`.

            parameters:
                Key-value pairs of parameters to use for the provider state.
                These must be encodable using [`json.dumps(...)`][json.dumps].
                Alternatively, a string contained the JSON object can be passed
                directly.

                If the string does not contain a valid JSON object, then the
                string is passed directly as follows:

                ```python
                (
                    pact.upon_receiving("a request").given(

        Add generators to the interaction.

        Generators are used to adjust how parts of the request or response are
        generated when the Pact is being tested. This can be useful for fields
        that vary each time the request is made, such as a timestamp.

                response. If `None`, then the function intelligently determines
