    Interaction between a consumer and a provider.

    This abstract class defines an interaction between a consumer and a

    # Interaction Part

    For HTTP and synchronous message interactions, the interaction is split into
    two parts: the request and the response. The interaction part is used to
    specify which part of the interaction is being set. This is specified using
    the `part` argument of various methods (which defaults to an intelligent
    choice based on the order of the methods called).

    The asynchronous message interaction does not have parts, as the interaction
    contains a single message from the provider (a.ka. the producer of the
    message) to the consumer. An attempt to set a response part will raise an
    error.

        passed to the provider so that its internal state can be set to match
        the provider state.

        In its simplest form, the provider state is a string. For example, to
        match a provider state of `a user exists`, you would use:

        ```python
