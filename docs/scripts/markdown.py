"""
Script to merge Markdown documentation from the main codebase into the docs.

This script is run by mkdocs-gen-files when the documentation is built and
imports Markdown documentation from the main codebase so that it can be included
in the documentation site. For example, a Markdown file located at
`some/path/foo.md` will be treated as if it was located at
`docs/some/path/foo.md` without the need for symlinks or copying the file.

If the destination file already exists (either because it is a real file, or was
otherwise already generated), the script will raise a RuntimeError.
