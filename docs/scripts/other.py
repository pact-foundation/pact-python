"""
Create placeholder files for all other files in the codebase.

This script is run by mkdocs-gen-files when the documentation is built and
creates placeholder files for all other files in the codebase. This is done so
that the documentation site can link to all files in the codebase, even if they
aren't part of the documentation proper.

If the files are binary, they are copied as-is (e.g. for images), otherwise a
HTML redirect is created.

If the destination file already exists (either because it is a real file, or was
otherwise already generated), the script will ignore the current file and
continue silently.
